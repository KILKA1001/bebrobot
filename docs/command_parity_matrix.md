# Command parity matrix (Discord ↔ Telegram)

This matrix reflects the current command parity between Discord and Telegram implementations, based on:

- `bot/commands/base.py`
- `bot/commands/fines.py`
- `bot/commands/tournament.py`
- `bot/commands/linking.py`
- `bot/telegram_bot/main.py`
- `bot/telegram_bot/commands/linking.py`

> **Definition of done rule:** Any new user-facing command in Discord or Telegram is considered complete only if this matrix is updated in the same change.
